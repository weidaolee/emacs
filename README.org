* Emacs
You may think of Emacs as of a text editor which is certainly true, 
but I would propose another definition.

Let's define Emacs as a programmable text-oriented user interface, 
which can be customized through programming because it not necessarily 
allows us to deal with files but we can do other things or actions 
which are not file related.
